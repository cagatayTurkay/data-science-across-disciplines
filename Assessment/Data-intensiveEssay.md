## Assessment Brief

In this assessment, you will be reporting and reflecting on a data science project that you carried out on a chosen question/topic that you approach through appropriate data and analytical techniques. Your **data-informed essays** will be reporting on a data science project that you carried out on a topic of your choosing. In the essay, you will be reporting the data science process from the formulation of the question, to analysis, and to evaluation, along with an in-depth reflection on the results and the process, while also engaging with the relevant literature. 

In the following, we first provide you a suggested process that you can follow to deliver this data-informed essay, we then present an indicative outline of what is expected in the essay.

### Suggested Process

Given the slightly unusual nature of this assessment, we like to give some recommendations on how you can approach this assessment: 

**P1)** **Identify a topic/question/problem and suitable data sets:**  Identify a topic or a (research) question that you would like to explore through a data science process. You are free to choose any topic but choose one that resonates with you and your background. While choosing your topic, ensure that there is also available data that you can make use of to support your investigation of the topic. Ensure that your topics and data sets are sufficiently complex, but also watch out for not being overly ambitious with what you want to explore given the timeline of this assessment.

**P2)** **Explore the literature in relation to your topic:** In order to build a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the topic and inform sub-questions/objectives that you want to explore, read the related literature and identify a few key papers that explored the same area as your topic. Look for how those key papers made use of data in their analyses. The objective here is not to conduct a full survey, so read sufficiently to gain an understanding of the problem space.

**P3)** **Establish the objectives of your analysis:** Building on your literature review and your review of available data sources, establish what you want to achieve in your analysis. Set well-informed objectives on what the analysis will aim to achieve and why these are important to respond to your overall research topic/question. The objectives should be built around sub-questions that will enable you to construct a suitable response to your main topic/question. Remember to also ask questions on data validity/representativeness as discussed in the lectures -- is the data fit for purpose, what would be some limitations you can expect, record such reflections to report them later on in your essay.

**P4)** **Design a suitable analysis methodology:** Considering your topic and the data available, plan a suitable methodology to respond to your research questions and achieve your objectives. Ask yourself questions on what data is available, what are its characteristics, how you can extract findings/observations to achieve the objectives of your analysis, what kinds of transformations will be needed, which analytical tools are suitable (e.g., if you want to identify similar entities, would clustering be a good choice?). 

**P5) Apply your analysis methodology:** Conduct your analysis following the plan you outlined. Apply data wrangling and transformation operations as needed, maybe merge data sets, or extract new data features,  and then employ appropriate analysis techniques (exploratory or modelling) discussed in the lectures, explore whether there is any benefit in using multiple models. While doing all these, remember to always to keep your critical hat on, are you falling for some statistical traps, may there be biases in the data or the model that is leading to an observation? Use Jupyter Notebooks to perform these operations and record results and decisions in your notebook as you go along.

**P6)** **Collate and report findings, learnings and understandings to respond to your topic/question:** Collate all your findings, learnings, and understandings that you made through your literature research and data analysis. Synthesise all of these and present your response to your topic/question.  Make references to the analytical explorations (such as figures, tables, model results) you made and reflect on how they are informing your arguments. (See further suggestions on the essay style below.)

Note that you will be finding yourself thinking and working on these phases simultaneously and there might be differences and variations in your case, so consider this as guidance and recommendation. And make sure that you build in room for flexibility and serendipity, remember the iterative nature of data science, you might find yourself going back and forth between the different phases and questioning your decisions at earlier stages.

### Data-informed Essay -- what is expected?

As a result of the data intensive exploration that you go through during the above process, you are expected to respond to your topic/question/problem through your data-informed essay. You will be assessed on your reporting in this essay. 

Even though you are free to follow any narrative structure that you see fit in your essay, here is some guidance on how you can structure your essay and the different discussions we would be expecting to see:

- **Abstract** (between 100-150 words): Summarise your project and main findings/observations. This is naturally the latest part of your essay to be written. 
- **Introducing the topic and context:** Introduce the topic that you are exploring by providing the context and the motivations on why this is important to study. We expect that you will be in dialogue with related literature here.
- **Questions, data, and methodology:** Describe the different sub-questions that you want to explore in relation to your topic, and present your aims and objectives. Also introduce the data that you will explore and reflect on the suitability and representativeness of the data. Then introduce us to your approach with an outline of your analysis methodology (without presenting the results) in relation to the questions that you want to respond to. Be clear on why you think the methodology is suitable for exploring your questions.
- **Synthesising Analysis, Results, Observations, and Reflections :** This is the core part of your essay where you discuss the different questions that you identified in relation to your topic. In your discussions, you are expected to synthesise all your findings, learnings, and understandings that you made through your literature research and data analysis. Make references to the analytical explorations you made (as represented through figures, tables, model results, etc.) and discuss how they are informing your arguments. Aim to clearly express how your understanding of the topic and arguments you are making are informed by your findings from the data. Explain how these data-driven artefacts could be seen as evidence to what you are arguing and claiming, and how the observations you are making positioned with respect to the literature you read -- do you observe results that are in agreement/conflict? In your discussions, report, as appropriate, any reflections on the limitations or biases that might be impacting your observations. Make sure that you are transparent and open about the decisions made at the different stages and how they might be impacting your observations.
- **Reflections and conclusions:** Reflect on your data-intensive process holistically. What are some cross-cutting limitations or issues that you faced, would you do any stages differently if you were to carry this project again? Conclude with some closing remarks on the overall observations, how well you were able to achieve your objectives, and re-visit some of your key observations while also making cases for further enquiry on your topic of investigation.

Note that the above are not section headers. They are mostly guidance for you to help decide on a structure and an indication for the different elements we will be looking for in your essays. 

**Note on Analysis Code:** We are not assessing your code separately in this assessment. But we expect you to keep a record of your analysis in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. When submitting your essays, convert your code into a pdf and add it as an appendix to your pdf file. But we are not expecting you to make references to your code or figures in your notebook.

## Ideas and inspiration for projects and data 

- A challenging one is [the Yelp Data Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge), which comprises a collection of data sets about business reviews,  social network activities, check-ins, etc. 
- For a financial focus, here is a [good resource on industries and companies](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/data.html).You can enrich your analysis by adding data and new perspective from data repositories of [World Bank ](http://data.worldbank.org/)and [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/data.htm).
- [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/data/search) is a great place to grab some data sets. Some of the data might be a  bit unstructured and might take some time to get ready for processing  but generally the data sets are relevant and updated. 
- For a more local focus, [London Datastore](http://data.london.gov.uk/) is a great place to start with. You can even think of linking some of  the data sets here to the ones in Summer Data Challenge described in the first bullet point.
- Visualizing.org has a nice [collection of data resources](http://www.visualizing.org/data/browse) which might help you to find relevant domains and datasets.
- [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) are another popular resource to find relevant data sources and problem  descriptions. 
- https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/ has a useful collection of consumer data in the UK.
- https://datahub.io/search -- this is another repository but a huge collection to explore

## Further advice, Q&A, and remarks

Here is a list of Q&As, remarks and advice to clarify any open questions you might have. We will be expanding this list as we receive some questions from you.

- **Is this a report or an essay?** this assessment falls somewhere between a technical report and a more conventional essay. Just like a technical report, you will be drawing from your analysis and you will be working with data but just like in an essay, you will be thinking about a topic/question and try to approach it from a broad perspective in dialogue with the relevant literature. The unique aspect here is to making effective use of your analytical findings and harmonising them within your overall discourse.
- **Effective use of visualisations --** making effective and good use of visualisations will be highly important. Make sure that you extract figures, annotate them if you need to, and include them in your essays with informative captions. Also refer to your figures from the body of your text.
- **Referencing --** pay attention to referencing styles and use a consistent style and tone in your references.
- **How do I know if my topic is suitable?** There is no easy answer to this. A good problem should be rich and interesting in a way that gives you multiple perspectives for discussions, and in this particular case, a good topic needs to be supported by suitable data sets that you can incorporate in your analysis. We reserve discussion to this in the final sessions of the year and please feel free to approach us if you are unsure.
- **Do I need to use all the techniques we learned?** Absolutely not! Choose one or two techniques that you think is suitable and construct your analysis around them. We are interested to see how well you identify suitable techniques and how well you extract supporting evidence from them to enrich your argumentation.
- **Will you assess the code in the notebooks?** No, we are not going to assess your work based on your code, nor we will attempt to run them. We ask you to append your code to the end just to get a sense of your analysis and to be able to refer to it if something is unclear.
