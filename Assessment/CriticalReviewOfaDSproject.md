### Assessment Brief

In this report, you will approach a selected Data Science project through a critical lens in dialogue with the topics and discussions covered within the module. This assessment expects you to: identify a data science project (see a list of recommended projects below) as reported through an article or a report; analyse the underlying motivations and questions; identify and assess the methodology, techniques employed and the data sources used; critically evaluate the inferences made, observations reported and if applicable any decisions or implications presented.  While discussing the above points, you are expected to engage both with the literature covered within the module but also any other key papers you identify in your evaluation. You are free to decide how to balance the emphasis of your report and could focus your critical review on some or all of these listed aspects of the data science project that you are reviewing.

You are strongly encouraged to present your own perspective and arguments, and if/where appropriate, propose alternative ways of approaching the limitations you identified. You can also bring in contrastive/supportive cases from other similar projects to support your arguments. You are free to ask and explore any relevant question in your critical review, but here are some -- non-exhaustive list of -- questions that could provide inspiration and starting points:

- Are the authors asking suitable, appropriate research and/or analytical questions? Have they formulated their motivations clearly? 
- Are suitable/appropriate data sources identified and used? Have the authors considered and acknowledged potential limitations, pitfalls in their choices of data? Any efforts to tackle them and if so how effective are they?
- What is the ethical dimension of the study, has any issues been raised transparently or are there any that are not discussed? Are there potential biases, any systematic under/over representation in the data? 
- Have they followed a suitable methodology? Are appropriate techniques being used? 
- What are the observations, insights that are drawn? Are they appropriate, well-founded and evidenced by the data?
- Are the implications of the study clearly presented and discussed? If not, what could be some? Do they consider whether any "bodies" are harmed or disadvantaged or advantaged (remembering the discussions in Data Feminism)?

Feel free to use these questions as initial thinking points and diverge from them as you see fit for the project that you are exploring.

### Data science projects to consider:

You are encouraged to pick one of the projects/studies listed below for your review. However, if you identified a different article/project/study outside this list that you are very keen to explore, please get in touch with Cagatay to discuss.

### Length and Format:

Follow the following length guidelines in your reports in relation to the CAT Level you are taking the module:

|                     | **15-CATS**  | **20 CATS**  | **30 CATS**  |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| **Critical Review** | (1000 words) | (1250 words) | (1500 words) |

Note that these word counts are indicating the maximum number of words to use, your report could use less words than this. For further guidance on word counts, etc. you can refer to the relevant section on the [CIM PG handbook](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/current-students/masters/2020-21_pgt_handbook_final_v1.pdf).

Make sure that you export your report in **pdf** format before you submit.

In terms of the format of the content, as mentioned above, you are free to structure your review in a way that you see fit. However, here are some suggestions: 

- We recommend that you start with some scene-setting and introduce the project briefly. You need to assume that your readers do not know all (or any of) the details of the project
- Use different sections and/or paragraphs to explore the distinct aspects, such as data, methodology, insights, in a coherent narrative.
- Feel free to include illustrations, figures, graphics from the projects you are reviewing to support your narrative. Remember to include a reference to the paper when you do so.
- Pay attention to referencing styles and use a consistent style and tone in your references.

### Submission:

You will submit your work through Tabula. You should have access to the submission link when that's available. If you have issues with the submission areas, please contact PG Course Administrator.

The deadline for the submission is ***Tue, 17th November 2020***. Make sure to submit your work in good time and do not leave it to the last minute!

Make sure that you export your report in **pdf** format before you submit.
