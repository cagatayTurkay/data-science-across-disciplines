# Data Science Across Disciplines

## Session-06: RECOGNISING AND AVOIDING TRAPS 

Data analysis and statistical routines and procedures are ingrained with several pitfalls and limitations -- these range from methodological pitfalls in the processes and data that once can use, to cognitive and behavioural pitfalls that one can come across in making inferences from data and data artefacts. This week we discuss such theoretical and practical traps and pitfalls, how we can be aware of them and what approaches we have to avoid them. 

## Highlights of the lecture

In the session, we will discuss causality and when and to what extent it can be expected and observed, and while also discussing the notion of confounding. We will then discuss statistical traps such as Simpson's paradox, regression to the mean, as well as touching upon the discussions of around the null-hypothesis testing process and the new statistics. We will also look at how visualisations can deceive and what we need to be careful about when representing data visually, as well as some of the cognitive biases that might have implications on how inferences and decisions based on data are made.

## Practical Lab Session

In the practical session, we will explore some examples of how such traps could be encountered in practice. We will then spend some considerable time on exploring data visualisations and making better decisions in designing effective visual representations to support our reasoning.

- **The New Statistics Debate:** Here is an easy read from Geoff Cummings on the "New Statistics" where there is also a link to his really fun to watch ["Dance of p-values" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez4DgdurRPg&ab_channel=GeoffCumming): Cumming , Geoff. “Mind Your Confidence Interval: How Statistics Skew Research Results.” *The Conversation*, 22 Oct. 2020.

The practical session involves hands-on examples where such traps are encountered and responded.

Some topics to discuss:

- Causality / correlation
- Simpson's paradox
- Confounding
- Regression to the mean
- Dance of p-values, p-hacking and new statistics
- Lying with visualisation
