# Data Science Across Disciplines

## Session-06: RECOGNISING AND AVOIDING TRAPS 

This week we discuss how we can be aware of various methodological and ethical traps and pitfalls that one can encounter during the data science process. We will discuss causality and when and to what extent it can be expected and observed, we will touch upon statistical traps such as Base-rate fallacy / prosecutor's fallacy, Simpson's paradox, as well as how visualisations can deceive and how to avoid representational traps.

The practical session involves hands-on examples where such traps are encountered and responded.
