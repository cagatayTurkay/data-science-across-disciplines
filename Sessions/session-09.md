# Data Science Across Disciplines

## Session-09: DATA SCIENCE WORKSHOP - 2 

This week will involve hands-on practical where we go through the data science process over applied examples. During the workshop, we will explore concepts such as reproducibility, openness and transparency and how best to communicate the analytical and reasoning process as well as critically reflecting on the various data artefacts produced. We will also explore concepts such as narrative and visual storytelling, as well as reflect on the design process for our analysis and artefacts.
