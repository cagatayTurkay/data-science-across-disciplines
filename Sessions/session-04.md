# Data Science Across Disciplines

## Session-04: STRUCTURES AND SPACES 

This week explores the notion of structures and how data science can enable the extraction of “hidden” underlying groups – clusters -- and hierarchical structures from data. We discuss the different techniques to surface and generate artificial boundaries and how the resulting artefacts can be interpreted. This session then investigates how artificial and abstract spaces can be constructed through different “projection” techniques, and how these spaces help us navigate data that are high-dimensional in nature and apply analytic frameworks to them.

The practical lab explores the use of clustering techniques, compares alternatives, and discusses interpretability issues, and we also review how we can deal with data sets that consists of several variables.
