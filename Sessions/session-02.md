# Data Science Across Disciplines

## Session-02: THINKING DATA: THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CONCERNS

This week explores the cultural, ethical, and critical challenges posed by data artefacts and data-intensive scientific processes. Engaging with Critical Data Studies, we discuss issues around data capture, curation, data quality, inclusion/exclusion and representativeness. The session also discusses the different kinds of data that one can encounter across disciplines, the underlying characteristics of data and how we can analytically and practically approach data quality issues and the challenge of identifying and curating appropriate data sets.

The practical lab session walks students through the earlier stages of the data science process. We start by looking at different types of data suitable for analysis within a data science framework and move on to how to wrangle the data to make it available for further use.
