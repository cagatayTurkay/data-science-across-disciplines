# Data Science Across Disciplines

## Session-05: MULTI-MODEL THINKING AND RIGOUR IN DATA SCIENCE 

This week we focus on multi-model approaches as a way of thinking and how critical, pluralistic thinking can improve our understanding of the underlying phenomena implicit in data. We also discuss how to adopt a comprehensive approach to the data science process, and investigate indicators of rigor in data science.

The practical session involves combining perspectives derived from different computational models, as well as considering how diverse theoretical frameworks can help us approach phenomena of interest in different ways.
