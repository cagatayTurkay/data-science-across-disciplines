# Data Science Across Disciplines

## Session-08: DATA SCIENCE WORKSHOP - 1 (DESIGN THINKING IN DATA SCIENCE) 

This week explores the question “Can we approach data science as a design problem?” and discusses how one can embrace a user-centred approach to design appropriate data science processes. We will do this through hands-on practical where we go through the data science process over applied cases.

Further notes: This week explores the question “Can we approach data science as a design problem?” and discusses how one can embrace a user-centred approach to design appropriate data science processes. We will explore how design thinking can inform and influence how we approach underlying problems, understand the interests and investments of different disciplines and expert stakeholders and how this can inform the design of analytic frameworks and disciplines accordingly.
