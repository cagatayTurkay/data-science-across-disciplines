# Data Science Across Disciplines

## Session-01: INTRODUCTION, HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES & BASIC CONCEPTS 

This week discusses data science as a field that cuts across disciplines and provides a historical perspective on the subject. We discuss the terms Data Science and Data Scientists, reflect on examples of Data Science projects, and discuss the research process at a methodological level. We will also use the examples as probes to think broadly on the potential influence of data-intensive scientific approaches on knowledge, industry and the wider society.

The practical lab session help students get acquainted with the analytical platform that will be used throughout the term and provides a first experience working with data sets within a data science approach.
