# Data Science Across Disciplines

## Session-01: INTRODUCTION, HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES & BASIC CONCEPTS 

This week discusses data science as a field that cuts across disciplines and provides a historical perspective on the subject. We discuss the terms Data Science and Data Scientists, reflect on examples of Data Science projects, and discuss the research process at a methodological level. We will also use the examples as probes to think broadly on the potential influence of data-intensive scientific approaches on knowledge, industry and the wider society.

The practical lab session help students get acquainted with the analytical platform that will be used throughout the term and provides a first experience working with data sets within a data science approach.

## Highlights of the lecture

This week we start by an introduction where we look at how the module is operating and discussing the basic objectives and definitions of the module.

Some of the key concepts you should remember from this week are ...

- the discussion about the terms Data Science and Data Scientists 
- the DS process and basic concepts from each step of the process
- Importance of being critical and inquisitive in data science
- different analyst types and skills

## Practical Lab Session

This week is mainly a setup week where you get introduced to the coding environment and to Python.

At the end of the session, you should  ..

- have installed Anaconda and run it from your account
- have tried out basic Python commands and reflect on how they operate
- have loaded your first data file into Python and read the data in it

### Python related resources:

Although we try to cover the basics in Python programming in this  tutorial, some of you, especially those who are new to Python, might  benefit from some external tutorials which cover the basics. There are  many resources online but here are some good links:

- **codecademy** has a free tutorial: http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python
- **Wikibooks for Python**: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer's_Tutorial_for_Python_3)
- **Learnpython** even has an interactive console on the web: http://www.learnpython.org/
