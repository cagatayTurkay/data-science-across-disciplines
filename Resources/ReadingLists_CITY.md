## Resources & Suggested Readings

A compilation of suggested readings from all the weeks.

# List of resources & suggested readings 

(**Update:** 27.10.2017)

Here is a list that merges the reading lists for all the 10 weeks.  These will be identical to the reading lists under each week's overview  section. Try to have a look at these resources to improve your  understanding of the topics covered in the lectures. You don't have to  read all of these to get through the assessments but refer to these for  points where you are unsure about some of the concepts and widen your  knowledge on the topics.

**Note:** This is a list that we rolled over from last  year, over the term, we will be adding/revising this list as we go along and expect changes in the weeks to come. Please treat this as a guiding reading list. We'll be keeping the latest update dates above as a  reference.
